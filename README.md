# Mod2Assess of VBA programming
## Challenge
This was indeed a very difficult challenge and I surely hope it was at least partially correct.  I uploaded two versions of the VBA.  The final version 2b has an attempt to refactor my code, using dynamic arrays, which failed.  The calculations would be ok, but the process stopped at the end of the first ticker value.  I cannot figure out why the dynamic array failed, even after attempting to follow my tutor who coached me through the process.  While my analysis using the static array approach worked, this dynamic array approach failed for me.  Even if I don't get a good grade for this, I did my best to "refactor" the code.
### Advantages of VBA over formulas
Once one is able to write some VBA code, it really speeds up the analysis of large files.  I am still in the process of learning how to write loops, variables, arrays and the like.  What I like is that once you have a working sub or module, the process of analyzing data is much less error-prone.  I can see the applications in my work, which often entails taking data from .csv files and putting it into spreadsheets for analysis.  Moreover, it would work with multiple .csv files.  However, with the learning of Python, I am thinking that Python may be the better option in the future.
