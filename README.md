# Mod2Assess of VBA programming
## Challenge
This was indeed a very difficult challenge and I surely hope it was at least partially correct.
### Advantages of VBA over formulas
Once one is able to write some VBA code, it really speeds up the analysis of large files.  I am still in the process of learning how to write loops, variables, arrays and the like.  What I like is that once you have a working sub or module, the process of analyzing data is much less error-prone.  I can see the applications in my work, which often entails taking data from .csv files and putting it into spreadsheets for analysis.  Moreover, it would work with multiple .csv files.  However, with the learning of Python, I am thinking that Python may be the better option in the future.
